# notfiles
These are my notfiles, which are like dotfiles except they're not, because i'm really bad at all this stuff. For now, here are some things you can find here:

| Directory | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [ahk](ahk/) | my meagre collection of [AHKv2](https://www.autohotkey.com/v2/) scripts. |
| [espanso](espanso/) | my old [Espanso](https://espanso.org/) matches. |

Future contents may include things like Vivaldi configuration things, Windows Terminal settings, arbitrary color schemes, or whatever else seems like it might be appropriate.
